🦭 Seal Content Management System
✨ Project Description
This project is all about seals. That's right — I freaking love seals, and now you can too.

With this system, you can upload and manage content like seal videos, seal images, and even YouTube links about seals, then send them to remote devices (screens) for playback. Whether it's a single screen or an entire army of seal-devoted devices, you're covered.

Soon, a companion app will be released to make it easier to register devices — so stay tuned.

SEALS ROCK. LET'S SPREAD THE LOVE.
